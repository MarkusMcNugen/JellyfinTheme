## üé® CSS Structure Breakdown

### Core Ultrachromic Theme Imports

```css
/* ============================================================================
   CORE ULTRACHROMIC THEME IMPORTS (Required Order)
   Documentation: https://github.com/CTalvio/Ultrachromic
   ============================================================================ */
```

This section establishes the foundation by importing Ultrachromic components in their required order. It includes fixes, fonts, and the base styling that everything else builds upon. The order is crucial for proper functionality.

### UI Layout Components

```css
/* UI Layout Components */
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CTalvio/Ultrachromic/rounding.css');
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CTalvio/Ultrachromic/smallercast.css');
/* Additional layout imports... */
```

These imports define the appearance of different interface elements, including rounded corners, compact episode lists, transparent headers, minimalistic login screen, field styling, and corner indicators.

### Type/Color Scheme

```css
/* Type/Color Scheme (REQUIRED - choose one) */
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CTalvio/Ultrachromic/type/dark_withaccent.css');
```

The dark theme with accent colors provides a sleek, modern look that's easier on the eyes for media consumption. It serves as the core color palette for the entire interface.

### Title Page and Progress Indicators

The title page styling creates banner-style layouts for media content pages with logo integration, while the progress indicators section provides floating progress bars that offer a clean, unobtrusive way to show media playback progress.

### Effects and External Additions

```css
/* Effects (should be last among Ultrachromic imports) */
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CTalvio/Ultrachromic/effects/hoverglow.css');
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CTalvio/Ultrachromic/effects/glassy.css');
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CTalvio/Ultrachromic/effects/pan-animation.css');
```

These effects add hover glow animations, glassmorphism (frosted glass appearance), and smooth pan animations to create a more dynamic interface.

### Plugin Enhancements

```css
/* Metadata Provider Icons Plugin */
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Druidblack/jellyfin-icon-metadata@main/public-icon.css");

/* Icon Replacements - Using Active Alternative to prayag17 */
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ealap/jellyfin-icons/Sharp.css");
```

These sections enhance the visual presentation of metadata by replacing text-based provider links with recognizable icons and implementing the Sharp icon set for a consistent look.

### My Media Small Section Styling

```css
/* ============================================================================
   MY MEDIA SMALL SECTION STYLING
   ============================================================================ */
```

This custom section creates elegant gradient-bordered buttons for the My Media section with special hover effects:

- Uses a transparent background with gradient borders
- Implements text gradient effects that change on hover
- Centers the section content for balanced presentation
- Creates a cohesive look that draws attention to library categories

### Backdrop Styling

```css
/* ============================================================================
   BACKDROP STYLING
   ============================================================================ */
```

The backdrop section enhances background images with blur, saturation, and contrast adjustments, while implementing mobile-specific animations that create a subtle scrolling effect for a more dynamic experience.

### Pause Screen Styling

```css
/* ============================================================================
   PAUSE SCREEN STYLING (BobHasNoSoul)
   From: https://github.com/BobHasNoSoul/Jellyfin-PauseScreen
   ============================================================================ */
```

This integration creates an enhanced pause screen experience:

- Plot description appears in a stylized, blurred container with accent-colored border
- Media logo displays prominently with drop shadow effects
- Optional spinning disc animation (hidden in this implementation)
- Automatically appears when video is paused and disappears when resumed
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Theme Not Loading

If the theme doesn't load properly:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache and reload
2. **Check CSS Syntax**: Ensure the CSS was pasted correctly without truncation
3. **Reverse Proxy Issues**: If using Nginx, add the following to your configuration:

```nginx
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src https: data: blob: http://image.tmdb.org; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.gstatic.com/cv/js/sender/v1/cast_sender.js https://www.youtube.com blob:; worker-src 'self' blob:; connect-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'self'";
```

### Mobile Issues

For optimal mobile experience:

1. Enable **Backdrops** in Settings > Display
2. Check that the theme renders correctly on different screen sizes
3. For any display issues, report them for future updates

### Plugin Integration Issues

If metadata icons aren't displaying correctly:
1. Ensure the Metadata Provider Icons import is at the top of your custom CSS
2. Check that you have metadata providers enabled in your library settings
3. For local metadata providers like Stash and Shoko, update the CSS with your server address

### Pause Screen Not Working

If the pause screen doesn't appear:
1. Make sure the custom CSS is applied server-wide
2. Try clearing the browser cache and reloading
3. Verify there are no JavaScript errors in the browser console
4. Check that media has proper metadata (logos, descriptions) in your library
